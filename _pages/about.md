# About Me

Hello! I am currently a junior majoring in **Artificial Intelligence** at [Beijing University of Technology](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/). My research interests include:

- **Multimodal Large Language Models**
- **Embodied Intelligence**
- **AI for Security Applications**

I am actively seeking **MPhil and PhD opportunities for Fall 2026**. I would be very grateful for the opportunity to further discuss my background and research. Please feel free to contact me at:  
- **Primary Email:** mstaryc02@gmail.com  
- **Institutional Email:** wangyc2002@emails.bjut.edu.cn  

Additionally, I am gradually posting algorithmic derivations of selected papers on my [Bilibili channel](https://space.bilibili.com/688302426). If you would like to learn more, feel free to visit the link.
